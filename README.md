# Biquadris: A Multiplayer Turn-Based Tetris Game

Biquadris is a programming project developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course (CS 246) at the University of Waterloo.

Written primarily in C++, this project leverages X11 libraries to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that can run on both Mac OS and Linux environments.

The game revolves around a turn-based strategy, allowing two players to engage in a Tetris-style gameplay concurrently. Each player is allocated their own Tetris board, taking turns maneuvering Tetris blocks until one player encounters a game-over situation. Excitingly, the game features special rules that enable players to disrupt their opponent's progress strategically.
